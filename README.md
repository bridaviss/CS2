### Project Description
This project aims to explore the impact of the FIFA World Cup on the prices of commodities of your choice.  These commodities should be central to the fanfare that is integral to the World Cup and that relationship should be clearly explained. For example, barley could be a potential commidity of interest due to it's involvement in the production of beer, which is a drink that is consumed a lot during sporting events. Using time-series data of your commodities, you will produce an analysis that will examine tbe significance of this impact and analysis of interest. Read the Hook Document for more information on why this will be a fun and informative analysis!
